"""MCP × LangGraph — load an MCP server's tools into a LangGraph agent.

This ties MCP back to the stack you already know. An MCP server exposes tools in
a language-agnostic way; `langchain-mcp-adapters` wraps each MCP tool as a normal
LangChain tool, so a LangGraph agent can call them just like any other tool.

What it shows:
  1. MultiServerMCPClient points at the stdio Kestrel server (kestrel_mcp_server.py).
  2. .get_tools() launches that server and returns its tools as LangChain tools.
  3. create_react_agent builds a LangGraph ReAct agent over those tools + a model.

The adapter API is async, so everything runs inside asyncio.run(main()).

How to run:
    python langgraph_mcp_client.py
It needs the MCP server reachable — here that just means kestrel_mcp_server.py
exists next to this file (the adapter spawns it as a subprocess automatically).

Model access is optional and graceful:
  * Provide OPENROUTER_API_KEY to ask a question end-to-end (uses OpenRouter's
    OpenAI-compatible endpoint via ChatOpenAI). Supply it SAFELY -- put it in a
    local `.env` file (gitignored) as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...`, or
    `export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...` in your shell. Never hard-code it here.
  * With no key, it still loads the MCP tools and prints their names, so the
    MCP-to-LangGraph wiring is demonstrated fully offline.

Requirements: pip install langchain-mcp-adapters langchain langgraph langchain-openai python-dotenv
